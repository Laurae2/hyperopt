# FIXED INSTALLATION OF HYPEROPT

INSTALLATION: pip install git+git://github.com/Laurae2/hyperopt.git

This fork is a fix for hyperopt installation that was either:
- Failing to install for some reason (renewang: https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt/issues/231)
- Failing to run properly due to fmin "module" (ghost: https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt/issues/234)

Solutions implemented: ghost's and renewang's.

Thanks,
Laurae
